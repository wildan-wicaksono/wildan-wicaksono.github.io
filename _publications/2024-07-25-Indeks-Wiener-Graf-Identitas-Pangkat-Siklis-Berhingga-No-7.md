<p align="justify"> An identity graph for a group is defined as a graph with a set of points consisting of group elements and two points connected by an edge if the product is an identity element or exactly one of the two points is an identity element in the group. A power graph of a group is defined as a graph with a set of points consisting of elements of the group and two points connected by an edge if one point can be written as a power of another point. In this research, we examine the formulation of the Wiener index for identity graphs and power graphs in finite cyclic groups. The results of the Wiener index formulation from identity graphs are divided into cyclical groups of order 1, odd order more than 1 and even order, while the power graph focuses on cyclic groups with the exponent of prime numbers and the product of two different primes. </p>
