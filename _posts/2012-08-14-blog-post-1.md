<p align="justify">
Let \(\overline{BD}\) and \(\overline{CE}\) be the altitudes of acute triangle \(ABC\). Let \(\omega_B\) and \(\omega_C\) be the circles with diameter \(\overline{BD}\) and \(\overline{CE}\), respectively. Suppose \(\overline{BD}\) intersect \(\omega_C\) at \(P\), \(\overline{CE}\) intersect \(\omega_B\) at \(R\), \(\omega_B\) and \(\omega_C\) intersects at \(X\) and \(Y\). If \(\overline{XY}\) intersect \(\overline{DE}\) at \(T\), prove that \(\overline{TP}=\overline{TR}\).</p>

The Idea
======

<p align="justify"> We may look at this problem's original diagram and put \(H\) as the orthocenter of \(ABC\). </p>

![original diagram](/images/blog1/g1.jpg){:.align-center width="500px"}

<p align="justify"> There is a fact that we can show that \(X\), \(Y\), and \(H\) are collinear (I know this from another exercise in some book). We can observe that \(H\) must lie on radical axis of \(\omega_B\) and \(\omega_C\), denote \(\mathcal{R}_{\omega_B,\omega_C}\). We might think it can be shown by <i>Power of Point Theorem</i> or <i>Radical Axis Theorem</i>. To do this, note that \(BEDC\) cyclic since \(\angle BEC=\angle BDC=90^\circ\). Now, we can observe that \(CE = \mathcal{R}_{\omega_C,(BEDC)}\) and \(BD = \mathcal{R}_{\omega_B,(BEDC)}\). By <i>Radical Axis Theorem</i>, we conclude that \(BE\), \(CE\), and \(XY\) concurrent at \(H\). Therefore, \(X\), \(Y\), and \(H\) are collinear.
