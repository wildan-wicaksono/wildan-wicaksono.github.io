<p align="justify">
Let \\(\overline{BD}\\) and \\(\overline{CE}\\) be the altitudes of acute triangle \\(ABC\\). Let \\(\omega_B\\) and \\(\omega_C\\) be the circles with diameter \\(\overline{BD}\\) and \\(\overline{CE}\\), respectively. Suppose \\(\overline{BD}\\) intersect \\(\omega_C\\) at \\(P\\), \\(\overline{CE}\\) intersect \\(\omega_B\\) at \\(R\\), \\(\omega_B\\) and \\(\omega_C\\) intersects at \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). If \\(XY\\) intersect \\(DE\\) at \\(T\\), prove that \\(\overline{TP}=\overline{TR}\\).</p>

The Idea
======

<p align="justify"> We may look at this problem's original diagram and put \\(H\\) as the orthocenter of \\(ABC\\). </p>

![original diagram](/images/blog1/g1.jpg){:.align-center width="500px"}

<p align="justify"> There is a fact that we can show that \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(H\\) are collinear (I know this from another exercise in some book).</p>

Solutions
