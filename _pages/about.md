I am Wildan (some call me Bagus), a third-year undergraduate math student at Universitas Brawijaya, East Java, Indonesia. I'm from Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia.

In general, I am interested in algebra, especially abstract algebra; analysis, especially real analysis and complex analysis. On the mathematics olympiad (for senior high school) interested in geometry, especially Euclidean geometry.

I am already interested in mathematics at junior high school. Geometry is the first place of my reason why I like mathematics. The real reason I don't know either, but to me it just seemed more interesting than algebra, number theory, and combinatorics. When I was junior high school, I was already interested books by Evan Chen, Euclidean Geometry in Mathematical Olympiad.
