<p align="justify"> I am Wildan (some call me Bagus), a third-year undergraduate math student at Brawijaya University, East Java, Indonesia. I'm from Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia.</p>

<p align="justify"> In general, I am interested in algebra, especially abstract algebra; analysis, especially real analysis and complex analysis. On the mathematics olympiad (for senior high school) interested in geometry, especially Euclidean geometry. </p>

<p align="justify"> I am already interested in mathematics at junior high school. Geometry is the first place of my reason why I like mathematics. The real reason I don't know either, but to me it just seemed more interesting than algebra, number theory, and combinatorics. When I was junior high school, I was already interested books by Evan Chen, Euclidean Geometry in Mathematical Olympiad. </p>

<p align="justify"> In $2023$ I became an assistant judge in the Olimpiade Sains Nasional (OSN), the most prestigious competition in Indonesia. This event is held by the Pusat Prestasi Nasional every year. In addition, I also became an assistant teaching in preparation for the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). </p>
