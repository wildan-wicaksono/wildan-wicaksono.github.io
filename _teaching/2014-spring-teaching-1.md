<p align="justify">Participating in the community service program, <b>Dosen Berkarya</b>, with Dr. Darmajid S.Si.,M.Si. and Dra. Andari, MS. for two days. Lecturing for teachers in Lampung on junior and senior high school about mathematical olympiads.</p>

What did I do?
======
<p align="justify">In this program, I managed to teach and assist my lecturer when teaching (as long as I didn't have another schedule). For senior high school, I teach about geometry and combinatorics: congruent and similarity of triangles, addition and multiplication principles. For junior high school, I teach about algebra and number theory: inequality and divisibility. The audience is very enthusiastic, especially when I talk about the divisibility of integers when divided by \(3\), \(4\), \(7\), \(9\), \(11\), and \(13\). They found a new trick on how to check this divisibility by using their property. </p>

Met Old Competitor
======
<p align="justify"> On Day 2, unexpectedly I met an old competitor when I was in senior high school, Denzel Elden Wijaya (now he takes an undergraduate at NTU). He was a strong competitor in the math olympiad. Shortly, now we know each other (I'm sure we have known each other previously, but never interacted). </p>
