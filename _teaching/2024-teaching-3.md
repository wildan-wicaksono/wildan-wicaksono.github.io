**2024**

Conducted four instructional sessions covering:
* Directed Angles.
* Ceva and Menelaus Theorems.
  
The first two sessions focused on comprehensive theoretical explanations followed by guided practice problems. The remaining two sessions were dedicated to problem-solving, where students worked through a set of ten selected geometry problems designed to strengthen their Olympiad-level reasoning.

**2025**

Conducted two advanced sessions on:
* Inversion.
* Complex Coordinates.
  
These sessions emphasized deeper theoretical development followed by challenging exercises within the remaining time. In addition, I served as a problem grader for several selection tests during the national training camp, contributing to the evaluation process for determining the country’s IMO delegation.

**2026**

Invited to teach at Stage II National Training Camp, delivering sessions on:
* Inversion.
* Projective Geometry.

All sessions were devoted to structured explanations of these extensive topics, followed by advanced problem-solving exercises.
