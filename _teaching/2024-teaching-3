<p align="justify">I became a teaching assistant in preparation for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 2024 (first stage). I teach about geometry: directed angle, Ceva Menelaus, and two other sessions are solving 10 problems (if they need a hint I will give it to them).</p>

<p align="justify">The training is conducted online via Zoom meeting. I have been scheduled for 4 sessions to teach geometry, especially Euclidean geometry. Two sessions I used by explaining about directed angle and Ceva Menelaus, followed by exercise. Two other sessions are focused on them to solve 10 problems which are given by me. </p>
